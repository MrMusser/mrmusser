  <h3>On the Use of Future Generations</h3>
  <h4>A Response to Nicholas Kristof</h4>
  <br>
  <p>Yesterday in the New York Times, Nicholas Kristof wrote a new article that begins this way:
    <br><br>“As we pull down controversial statues and reassess historical figures, I’ve been wondering what our great-grandchildren will find bewilderingly immoral about our own times — and about us.
    <br><br>“Which of today’s heroes will be discredited? Which statues toppled? What will later generations see as our own ethical blind spots?”
    <br><br>Kristof identifies three areas where future generations are likely to view us with opprobrium: our cruelty to animals (to which he dedicates 12 paragraphs), our lack of care for impoverished nations (which gets 2 paragraphs), and our climate denialism (also 2 paragraphs). Note that Kristof presents climate denialism as the thing that will elicit future generations’ ire, not our inaction per se; it is the denialism and not the inaction that “will lead to more extreme weather, more flooded homes, more heat waves….” (This two paragraphs, being so short, are not representative of Kristof’s broader writing on climate change, which I generally find far more enlightening.)
    <br><br>I see this argument—or one of its infinite variations—quite frequently, and I happen to think it encapsulates a lot of what is wrong with 1) our tendency to judge our present actions through the eyes of some imaginary future observer; 2) the odd way in which we tend to view said moral judgment as an intellectual exercise without reference to material realities; and 3) the deadening skepticism which these types of arguments inadvertently justify. Points 1 and 3 are closely related and point 2 is the easiest to discuss, so I will begin there.
    <br><br>Let’s imagine that for the duration of the next 100 years, nothing whatsoever is done to check any of the three moral failings Kristof identifies. We continue to raise animals in extraordinarily vile conditions and slaughter them mercilessly. Every four years, we switch between providing trivial aid and no aid at all to the developing world, while defending an economic system that exploits the labor of vast swathes of humanity but that, at the same time—it must be confessed—allows for the very gradual economic growth of these regions under ideal conditions of capitalist trade. But because we have done nothing about climate change and have, in fact, only increased our annual emissions, “ideal conditions” very much do not obtain and the developing world has not been able to advance very far at all. Severe weather events kill millions while causing food shortages that kill tens of millions which in turn cause civil unrest that kills hundreds of millions. (In all reality, I think the civil unrest is only likely to kill tens of millions while food shortages might threaten to kill hundreds of millions, but it sounded better when written the other way around.)
    <br><br>Now let’s imagine a typical resident of the 22nd century looking back to judge us. Would such a person care particularly much about our treatment of animals? Even if the world had reformed on that point (to give them the benefit of a bit of moral distance), would their primary concern really be how we treated our livestock? Would they, in their own personal lives, feel a material impact of our moral failing in that regard? I suspect not. I suspect that if their lives had been made demonstrably more wretched principally by our refusal to take any meaningful action on climate change, then it stands to reason that their resentment would fall quite squarely on that issue—and who cares how we killed our chickens?
    <br><br>Now, if next year we were to suddenly cut our emissions to 0, abolish factory farms, and initiate a massive transfer of wealth to the developing world, things might be different. If none of these moral failings had any material impact on the lives of our future judges, it is entirely possible that they would resent us for our cruelty to animals at a ratio of six paragraphs to one relative to our climate inaction. Certainly the act itself—the act of boiling a chicken alive—is more facially cruel than the act of buying a home where one must commute by car each day. But why is it that when Kristof considers the way in which future generations will remember us, he defaults to an assumption that they will reach their conclusions more or less unswayed by the material impacts of any of the actions which they judge?
    <br><br>Kristof’s actual article is framed as a discussion about Confederate monuments, so it is worth broaching the topic of slavery here, because when Kristof talks about judging our ancestors, he appears to talk in such a way that the act of judging is that of a morally enlightened, impartial observer who is not himself implicated in any of the actions which he judges. Kristof can talk this way because Kristof likely does not feel any material consequences of several centuries of brutalized and systematic chattel slavery. But the same cannot be said of millions of Black Americans who do still feel quite serious material consequences. When Kristof imagines the judges-of-the-future, he again imagines a detached panel that can judge with equanimity between the ways in which we killed our bovine and the ways in which we destroyed the environment and made it impossible for them to feed their families. But would our future critics really be able to be so detached in their assessment of us?
    <br><br>This brings me back to my concerns about using “future generations” as a stand-in for how we judge our present actions. The last few paragraphs have meant to suggest that when we talk about how “future generations” will judge us, we can do it in one of two ways: by imagining that future generations will be detached and impartial in their judgements (call this the impartial observer approach), or by imagining that they will in fact continue to bear the impact of the choices we make today (call this the affected observer approach). It is not self-evident which method is better. If we want to judge Confederate generals, ought we to try to take a nuanced view of their motivations, extracting ourselves from the ways in which their actions continue to impact us today, or ought we to privilege the judgements of those who continue to be materially impacted by their choices—namely Black Americans? (I have my own beliefs regarding which approach is better, but I raise this only to say that it is not self-evident that one mode of deliberation is strictly more justified than the other.)
    <br><br>If we judge ourselves by the affected observer approach, we risk reifying a form of consequentialism that can make us blind to our moral failings that will not directly impact future humans. I in fact share much of Kristof’s concern regarding the treatment of animals and do think that it is a deep flaw in our current society; I simply disagree that future generations (that is, generations of affected observers, people who actually share our world) will share his emphasis on animal cruelty relative to climate change.
    <br><br>On the other hand, if we judge ourselves by the impartial observer approach, it is unclear why we should bother talking about “future generations” at all, since we are not actually interested in the actual human beings who will live after us, but rather in the ideal judges that might observe our society now and evaluate it. One hypothesis I have seen—I cannot remember where—is that the language of “future generations” has in many ways come to be a stand-in for what previous generations would have treated as the impartial judgment of the Almighty. We have changed our label because the Almighty’s character judgments are no longer particularly well-received, but the function—an impartial observer, unswayed by the material consequences of what has come before them but capable of passing a well-formed judgment regarding moral decisions—is the same. There is still, I think, a problem with this approach. Though I do not think we should principally evaluate our own society in consequentialist terms, it is surely an important part of that evaluation, which requires us to remember future generations as real human beings whose material circumstances we are actively shaping; we ought not to simply use the language of “future generations” to refer to some quasi-divine judge that will judge us from an impartial standpoint.
    <br><br>This brings me to the third point I initially raised: that the impartial observer approach seems to generate a pernicious form of skepticism regarding moral norms. I tend to think that if we want to judge our own actions, we ought to ask both whether what we are doing is right or wrong (a question which resembles the impartial observer approach) and whether what we are doing will hurt others (a question which resembles the affected observer approach). While both questions are important, “right” and “wrong” are in many ways much more slippery concepts than “harm.” By this I mean: we could dedicate years today to arguing about whether future generations will view our animal cruelty or our climate inaction as more “wrong,” but it is hard to think that they will be more affected by our animal cruelty than our climate inaction. In this way, adopting the affected observer approach (which Kristof does not do) helps to clarify the stakes.
    <br><br>In general, I tend to suspect that this moral hand-wringing about “future generations” often introduces more confusion than it brings clarity. I am constantly hearing that just as previous generations could not have known how they would be judged, nor can we know how the future will judge us, so we ought to be humble in our judgment of the past. I am all for humility in judgment, but this argument seems to miss the point. We can in fact predict quite well why future generations will loathe us—at least we can if we treat them as affected observers, and not impartial moral philosophers. To be sure, there are some moral developments which may be hard to anticipate; the average American a hundred years ago may have been quite capable of living a full life without ever being explicitly made aware that there existed a meaningful class of individuals with transgender identities. Such a person would have been unable to predict some of our current moral norms. But for most generation-defining moral struggles, I do not think the historical record supports the claim that previous generations really could not have anticipated how moral norms would change. Historians are constantly reminding us that many of the American Founders believed that the institution of slavery would one day need to be destroyed—even as they themselves continued to own slaves.
    <br><br>We are used to thinking of moral deliberation as an activity that must consider many different angles and account for many different perspectives, that moral deliberation takes time and its conclusions are tentative and subject to change. This is all, I think, in some ways true. But it does not follow that future generations will have similar difficulty figuring out why to hate us, nor does it follow that it should take us very long to figure out what reason they will settle on for hating us. It is very obvious—or at least, it is so obvious to me that it confuses me when others do not seem to see how obvious it is—that the principal reason we will be hated in the future is our climate inaction. (I suspect people will not even care about our climate denialism, except insofar as it led to climate inaction, in the same way that I do not care whether William Jennings Bryan believed in evolution or not, except insofar as his arguments against it help sow the seeds of a pervasive doubt in science that has made it harder today to achieve climate action.)
    <br><br>Why, then, all these articles and thinkpieces about how we ought to be humble in judging the past since we cannot know how the past will judge us? (Here I am no longer explicitly responding to Kristof’s piece, since he actually did present three clear reasons why future generations will likely judge us; more typically, however, the question seems to be posed without an attempt to answer it.) We can in fact know—with quite a bit of certainty—that in the future, we will be mocked and despised for our climate inaction. And if the least bit of critical reflection can indicate to us why we will be hated in the future, surely we can imagine that slaveowners and Confederates in the past could have been as capable of as under-taxing a reflection?
    <br><br>I did say previously that I am all for humility, and I suppose it makes sense to conclude by saying that I am for one type of humility, but not the type that our hand-wringing about our own future cancellations seems intended to generate. I see little point in being epistemically humble about why future generations will judge us, and so I see little point in being epistemically humble in our judgment of previous generations’ ignorance. But precisely because it is actually quite easy to see our own failings with a bit of self-reflection, yet difficult to extricate ourselves from those failings, I am all in favor of making our judgments with the humility that comes from knowingly being complicit in evil—a humility that I feel every time I fly on a plane or buy a book from Amazon or bite into a burger. In other words, I believe that to recognize injustice is quite a bit easier than many people like to pretend it is, but to extricate oneself from injustice is quite a bit more difficult than we like to imagine, and it is because of this belief that I am willing to say we ought to be humble in how and why we judge others. “For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing.”
