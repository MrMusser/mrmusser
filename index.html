        <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
        <p>I am a recent graduate of Georgetown University, where I studied government with a concentration in
          political theory. My major area of interest is in the relationship between poltiics and technology, and down the line
          I'm hoping to go to grad school to study law and technology. For now, I'm looking for a job related to tech or tech
          policy where I can build up my skills, ideally at a small company or in a role where I can quickly take on new
          responsibilities. I've written a significant amount on bioethics and biotechnology but have also been teaching myself
          Python, data science, and machine learning techniques. The content on this page should demonstrate my skills in the
          areas of policy research, computer science (primarily shown through a portfolio of some data visualization projects), and
          general writing ability. (As well as HTML and CSS: everything on this page is coded from scratch!)</p>
        <p>Some of my upcoming projects include: a paper using natural language processing to examine the differences in the way that
          scientists, bioethicists, and government commissions speak to the public about <a href='https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/genomicresearch/genomeediting' target='_blank'>
          CRISPR</a>, an ethics paper discussing the political ethics of investment in new technologies, and a short
          story exploring the potential social impact of widespread <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/style/barbra-streisand-cloned-her-dog.html' target='_blank'>
          pet cloning</a>. Check back in soon to see more of my work!</p>

            <p>Every year, the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace, and Security uses a dozen different measures to assign a WPSI
              score to all countries, as well as sub-regions in India, Nigeria, and China. The top map in this figure shows the WPSI scores for all
              Chinese provinces, with the closeness indicating very little variation.</p>
            <p>Surprisingly, however, this lack of variation is not due to the fact that similar conditions prevail for women throughout
              China. Rather, there is wide variation on some sub-metrics, as shown in the bottom two maps. However, regions that perform
              well on one measure tend to perform badly on others, leading to the "squeeze" in overall WPSI scores seen in the top map.</p>

              severe gentrification in the northwest and northeast regions of the city.</p>
